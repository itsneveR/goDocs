- select is a control srtucture that works on the channels 
    we use select when we have multiple channels and we dont know when one would be ready to write or read
    select statement would allow us to use a channels when its ready. 

    we usually use select inside a for loop 

    for range list {
		select {
		case r := <-result:
			if r.err != nil {
				log.Println(r.url, "  ", r.err)
			} else {
				log.Println(r.url, "   ", r.timeout)
			}
		case <-stopper:
			log.Println("timeout")
		}

	}
