the Context package offers a common method to cancel requests

    -explixt cancellation (you just call the cancel function)
    -implicit cancellation based on timeout or deadline 
        (when time is out, the channel signals)

   *context work with select, make sure you know enough about them.

    a context offers two controls: 
       - a channel that closes(can be read from/can't be written into) when the cancellation occures  
       - an error that's readable once channel closes
                the error tells you whether the request was cancelled or timed out 


                we often use the channel from Done() function in a Select block 


    a context is an immutable tree structure.


    *the context value should always be the first parameter in the function body. (convention)
        func MYFUNC(ctx context.Context, urls []string) (int) {...}
